#### About the project:
Contio is a web application that connects Students and Mentors for sharing, gaining knowledge and making friends. Students search for mentors by subject and skills, our main goal is to make education accessible to everyone. As a result, we decided to build Contio, so that working professionals, students, or anyone else who wants to share their knowledge in order to help or improve themselves could engage with children and make them feel comfortable with learning could do so.
